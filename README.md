# Academic Projects
**Melbourne Housing Price Prediction** – Building model ML **Linear Regression** to predict housing prices in Melbourne. And discovered that the house has more number of rooms, number of bedrooms and bathrooms then this has a higher price, geographical location as longitude, latitude located in the city center or near city center make price high. Use Python and library sklearn, pandas, seaborn, scipy, numpy.

**Give Me Some Credit** – Building model ML Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and LightGBM in credit scoring by predicting possible person will encounter financial difficulties. Model LightGBM has the best result, with an accuracy of 87% on a training set and an accuracy of 86% on a testing set. Use programming language Python with libraries such as sklearn, pandas, numpy, lightgbm, seaborn, imblearn, scipy, shap.

**Handwritten number recognition MNIST** – Handwritten number recognition uses the MNIST dataset. Use model Logistic Regression with softmax function and technique gradient descent. The programming language is Python attached with some libraries such as numpy, and scipy.

**Detection Fruits** – Building model Neural Network for fruit recognition based on the Fruit 360 dataset. Writing by programming language Python and TensorFlow.

**Splitting Vietnamese word** – With algorithm Ngram, we implement word separation on a dataset in websites of online newspaper pages. Writing by programming language Python.

**Mobile application used for selling books** – Based on technology: React native, C#.

**Analytics and Statistics about E-commerce** – Statistical analysis of the development of E-commerce in Brazil based on the olist dataset on the Kaggle website. Building model semantic analysis from order reviews. Use techniques of natural language processing and model LogisticRegression to analyze reviews from users either positive or negative.

**Model use for detection Alzheimer disease by model deep learning** – Implement model CNN to detect Alzheimer's disease through MRI image dataset. With an accuracy of 99% on 6400 MRI images with four classes corresponding with each disease state. Writing in Python with libraries such as pandas, numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, PIL, and streamlit.
